## Critical Issues & Challenges

### 1. MCP SDK Compatibility Crisis

**Problem**: Major breaking changes between SDK versions

- Version 0.5.0: Works with basic implementations
- Version 1.20.1: Complete API overhaul, setRequestHandler broken

**Impact**: Custom MCP servers cannot be started
**Workaround**: Pin to 0.5.0 for existing servers
**Recommendation**: Rewrite custom servers for 1.x API or maintain dual implementation

**Technical Details**:

```javascript
// 0.5.0 API (working)
server.setRequestHandler("tools/list", handler)

// 1.20.1 API (broken)
requestSchema undefined error in protocol.js:368
```

### 2. Module System Inconsistency

**Problem**: Mix of CommonJS and ES modules causing import failures
**Examples**:

- Bridges use require() but package.json has "type": "module"
- PM2 ecosystem config cannot load ES modules

**Solutions Implemented**:

- Converted Gemini bridge to ES modules
- Maintained CommonJS for PM2 configs

### 3. Process Management Complexity

**Problem**: 23+ concurrent servers with interdependencies
**Challenges**:
