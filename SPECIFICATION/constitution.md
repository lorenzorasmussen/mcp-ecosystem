# MCP Ecosystem Documentation Constitution

## Purpose

This constitution establishes the principles and standards for maintaining living documentation within the MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem project. We believe that documentation should be a first-class citizen that evolves alongside code, never becoming stale or disconnected from reality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Documentation as Code
- All documentation lives in version control alongside the code it describes
- Documentation follows the same review process as code changes
- Automated validation ensures documentation accuracy and completeness

### 2. Living Documentation
- Documentation automatically detects and syncs with code changes
- Spec-driven development ensures documentation precedes implementation
- Continuous monitoring identifies documentation drift in real-time

### 3. Single Source of Truth
- Specifications serve as the authoritative source for requirements
- API documentation is generated from code annotations
- Architecture decisions are recorded and versioned

### 4. Developer Experience First
- Documentation is discoverable, searchable, and accessible
- Examples are tested and guaranteed to work
- Onboarding documentation enables rapid team integration

## Documentation Standards

### Specification Format
- All feature specifications follow the Spec-Kit 4-phase process:
  1. **SPECIFY**: Define what & why (goals, users, requirements)
  2. **PLAN**: Define how (architecture, tech stack, dependencies)
  3. **TASKS**: Break into actionable work items
  4. **IMPLEMENT**: Build to spec with continuous sync

### Quality Requirements
- All code examples must be executable and tested
- API documentation must be generated from OpenAPI specifications
- Architecture diagrams must be created with standardized tools (Mermaid/PlantUML)
- All documentation must pass accessibility and readability checks

### Review Process
- Documentation changes require peer review
- Subject matter experts must validate technical accuracy
- User experience review ensures clarity and discoverability
- Automated checks validate links, formatting, and consistency

## Tooling and Automation

### Spec-Kit Integration
- GitHub Spec-Kit manages the specification lifecycle
- AI-assisted spec generation ensures consistency
- Automated drift detection identifies code-spec misalignment
- CI/CD integration validates documentation on every commit

### Synchronization Engine
- Git hooks trigger documentation updates on code changes
- AST analysis detects semantic changes in codebase
- Automated PR generation for critical documentation updates
- Dashboard provides real-time documentation health metrics

### Quality Assurance
- Link checking ensures all references are valid
- Spell checking and grammar validation maintain professionalism
- Accessibility testing ensures WCAG compliance
- Performance monitoring ensures fast documentation loading

## Governance

### Ownership
- Each feature specification has a designated owner
- Documentation architects maintain overall system consistency
- Subject matter experts validate domain-specific content
- Engineering leads ensure technical accuracy

### Metrics and KPIs
- Documentation coverage: Percentage of code documented
- Freshness: Age of most recent documentation updates
- Accuracy: Percentage of documentation that matches code
- Usage: Analytics on documentation access and search patterns

### Continuous Improvement
- Regular documentation audits identify gaps and opportunities
- User feedback drives prioritization of improvements
- Tooling upgrades enhance automation and efficiency
- Training programs maintain team documentation skills

## Success Criteria

We will consider our documentation system successful when:

1. **Zero Documentation Debt**: All code changes are reflected in documentation within 24 hours
2. **100% Test Coverage**: All documentation examples are automatically tested
3. **Instant Discoverability**: Developers can find any information within 10 seconds
4. **Self-Service Onboarding**: New team members become productive without manual guidance
5. **Stakeholder Confidence**: Non-technical stakeholders can understand system capabilities
