# Code Review Guidelines

## Overview

This guide establishes standards for code reviews to ensure code quality, knowledge sharing, and maintainable codebase.

## Review Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Self-Review**: Review your own code first
2. **Test Coverage**: Ensure adequate test coverage
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Linting**: Run linting and fix all issues
5. **Build**: Ensure the project builds successfully

## Review Guidelines

### For Reviewers

1. **Be Constructive**: Focus on improvement, not criticism
2. **Explain Why**: Provide reasoning for suggestions
3. **Prioritize**: Focus on important issues first

2. **Explain Decisions**: Provide context for choices
3. **Respond Promptly**: Address comments in timely manner
4. **Update PR**: Make requested changes
5. **Thank Reviewers**: Appreciate their time

## Review Types

### Feature Reviews

- Focus on functionality and user experience
- Verify requirements are met
- Check integration with existing code

### Bug Fix Reviews

- Verify the fix actually resolves the issue
- Check for regression
- Ensure test coverage for the bug

### Refactoring Reviews

- Ensure behavior is preserved
- Check for improved maintainability
- Verify performance improvements

## Common Issues to Look For

### Security

- Input validation
- Authentication/authorization
- Sensitive data exposure
- SQL injection vulnerabilities

### Performance

- Inefficient algorithms
- Memory leaks
- Unnecessary database queries
- Large object creation

### Maintainability

- Complex functions that should be split
- Magic numbers and strings
- Inconsistent naming
- Missing error handling

## Tools

### Automated Checks

- ESLint for JavaScript
- Prettier for formatting
- Jest for testing
- SonarQube for code quality

### Manual Review

- GitHub pull request reviews
- Pair programming sessions
- Code walkthroughs

## Approval Process

1. **Minimum Reviewers**: At least one reviewer required
2. **Approval Required**: All reviewers must approve
3. **CI Checks**: All automated checks must pass
4. **Merge**: Author can merge after approval

## Escalation

If there's disagreement:

1. Discuss in pull request comments
2. Schedule a meeting if needed
3. Involve tech lead for final decision
