# CI/CD Pipeline Guide

## Overview

This guide describes the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the MCP Ecosystem project.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Stages

1. **Code Quality** - Linting, formatting, static analysis
2. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, coverage
3. **Security** - Vulnerability scanning, dependency checks
4. **Build** - Package creation, artifact generation
5. **Deploy** - Staging deployment, production deployment

### Environments

- **Development**: Feature branches
- **Staging**: Release candidates
- **Production**: Released versions

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Main Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test:coverage
      - run: npm run coverage:check
```

### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm run build
          npm test
      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
```

## Quality Gates

### Code Quality

- **ESLint**: No linting errors allowed
- **Prettier**: Code must be formatted
- **TypeScript**: No type errors (if applicable)

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: 100% pass rate required
- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: All critical paths covered

### Security

- **Dependency Scan**: No high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Code Analysis**: No security anti-patterns
- **Secrets**: No hardcoded secrets detected

## Branch Strategy

### Main Branch

- Protected branch
- Requires pull request review
- All checks must pass
- Auto-merge enabled for approved PRs

### Develop Branch

- Integration branch
- Feature branches merge here
- Automated testing on every push
- Regular merges to main

### Feature Branches

- Created from develop
- Naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Deleted after merge

## Automated Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# End-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```

### Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage:report

# Check coverage threshold
npm run coverage:check
```

## Deployment Process

### Staging Deployment

- Triggered on merge to develop
- Automatic deployment to staging environment
- Integration tests run against staging
- Manual approval required for production

### Production Deployment

- Triggered on tag creation
- Automated deployment to production
- Health checks performed
- Rollback on failure

### Rollback Process

```bash
# Identify previous version
git log --oneline

# Rollback to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Create hotfix tag
git tag -a v.X.Y.Z-hotfix -m "Hotfix rollback"

# Deploy rollback
npm run deploy:rollback
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Pipeline Monitoring

- Build success/failure rates
- Test execution times
- Coverage trends
- Security scan results

### Application Monitoring

- Error rates
- Performance metrics
- Resource utilization
- User experience metrics

### Alerting

- Slack notifications for failures
- Email alerts for critical issues
- Dashboard monitoring
- Incident response procedures

## Environment Configuration

### Development Environment

```bash
# Local development setup
npm install
npm run dev

# Environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Staging Environment

- Mirror of production
- Realistic data volumes
- Full feature set
- Performance testing

### Production Environment

- High availability setup
- Load balancing
- Database replication
- Backup and recovery

## Security Practices

### Code Security

- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection
- Code review requirements

### Infrastructure Security

- Secure container images
- Network security groups
- Access control
- Audit logging

### Deployment Security

- Signed commits
- Immutable infrastructure
- Secrets management
- Compliance checks

## Performance Optimization

### Build Performance

- Parallel test execution
- Cached dependencies
- Incremental builds
- Optimized Docker images

### Deployment Performance

- Blue-green deployments
- Canary releases
- Database migrations
- Feature flags

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Check logs
gh run view --log

# Debug locally
npm run build
npm test
```

#### Test Failures

```bash
# Run specific test
npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific test"

# Debug with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- --verbose
```

#### Deployment Issues

```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods

# View logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/app
```

## Best Practices
