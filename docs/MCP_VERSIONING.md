# MCP Ecosystem Versioning

This document outlines the versioning scheme for the MCP ecosystem components.

## Versioning Scheme

We follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer) for all MCP ecosystem components:
- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when we make backward compatible bug fixes

## Current Versions

| Component | Version | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| MCP Client Bridge | v1.0.0 | Intelligent intermediary for natural language to tool calls |
| MCP Server Framework | v1.0.0 | Base framework for MCP servers |
| MCP Proxy | v1.0.0 | Proxy server for routing requests |
| MCP Orchestrator | v1.0.0 | System orchestrator for managing MCP services |

### Server Categories

| Category | Version | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| AI Servers | v1.0.0 | AI-focused services (Gemini Bridge) |
| LLM Servers | v1.0.0 | Large Language Model services (Mem0) |
| Memory Servers | v1.0.0 | Memory management services |
| Communication Servers | v1.0.0 | Communication platform integrations |

## Version Management

### Release Process

1. **Development**: All work done in feature branches
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing before merging
3. **Version Bump**: Update version in package.json and documentation
4. **Tagging**: Git tag with semantic version (e.g., v1.2.3)
5. **Release**: Create GitHub release with changelog
6. **Publish**: Publish to package registries if applicable

## Versioning Tools

### Git Tags
All releases are tagged in Git with semantic versions:
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Package.json Updates
Each component's package.json is updated with the new version:
```json
{
  "name": "@qwen/mcp-client-bridge",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "..."
}
```

### Changelog Management
Each release includes a detailed changelog documenting:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Breaking changes
- Deprecations
- Performance improvements

## Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
Minor and patch versions maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing APIs continue to work
- Configuration files remain valid
- Data formats are preserved

### Forward Compatibility
Major versions may introduce breaking changes:
- Migration guides provided
- Deprecation warnings in previous versions
- Extended support for previous major versions

## Best Practices

1. **Always bump version** when making changes
2. **Follow SemVer** strictly for predictable updates
3. **Document breaking changes** in release notes
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** in minor versions
5. **Provide migration guides** for major versions
6. **Test thoroughly** before releasing
7. **Tag releases** in Git for traceability
