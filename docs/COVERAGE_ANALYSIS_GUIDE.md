## Installation

The coverage analysis system is included in this project. No additional installation required.

## Usage

### Basic Coverage Analysis

```bash
# Run complete coverage analysis
npm run coverage

# Generate detailed report
npm run coverage:report

# Auto-generate test improvements
npm run coverage:improve

# Check coverage against threshold (CI mode)
npm run coverage:check
```

### Advanced Usage

```bash
# Custom threshold
node tools/scripts/coverage-analysis.js --threshold 90

# Skip report generation
node tools/scripts/coverage-analysis.js --no-report

# CI mode with custom output
node tools/scripts/coverage-analysis.js --ci --threshold 85 --output ./reports
```

## Output Examples

### Coverage Metrics

```
üìä Current Coverage Metrics:
  ‚Ä¢ Overall Coverage: 75%
  ‚Ä¢ Lines Coverage: 75%
  ‚Ä¢ Functions Coverage: 80%
  ‚Ä¢ Branches Coverage: 70%
  ‚Ä¢ Statements Coverage: 75%

üéØ Coverage Threshold: 80%
üìà Status: ‚ùå FAIL (üî¥ 75%)
```

### File Analysis

```
üö® Coverage Issues Identified:
  ‚Ä¢ Completely Uncovered Files: 3
  ‚Ä¢ Low Coverage Files (<50%): 2

üìã Uncovered Files:
  ‚Ä¢ src/uncovered-utils.js
  ‚Ä¢ src/api-client.js
  ‚Ä¢ src/database.js
```

### Improvement Recommendations

```
üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Completely Uncovered Files:
  ‚Ä¢ src/uncovered-utils.js
    ‚Üí Create basic unit tests for all public functions
    ‚Üí Add integration tests for component interactions
    ‚Üí Estimated coverage gain: 60-80%
```

## Generated Files

### Test Templates

For uncovered files, the system generates basic test templates:

```javascript
import { uncoveredUtils } from "./uncovered-utils";

describe("uncoveredUtils", () => {
  // TODO: Add comprehensive tests
  it("should be defined", () => {
    expect(uncoveredUtils).toBeDefined();
  });

  // Add more test cases based on function analysis
  // - Test all public functions
  // - Test error conditions
  // - Test edge cases
  // - Test integration scenarios
});
```

### CI/CD Workflows

GitHub Actions workflow for continuous coverage monitoring:

```yaml
name: Test Coverage
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  coverage:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - name: Run tests with coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage
      - name: Coverage Report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### Coverage Reports

Comprehensive markdown reports with:

- Executive summary
- Detailed metrics
- File-by-file analysis
- Improvement recommendations
- Effort estimation

## Configuration

### Jest Configuration

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  collectCoverage: true,
  collectCoverageFrom: ["src/**/*.js", "!src/**/*.test.js"],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80,
    },
  },
};
```

### Python Coverage

```ini
# .coveragerc
[run]
source = .
omit = */tests/*

[report]
exclude_lines =
    pragma: no cover
    def __repr__
    if self.debug:
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Coverage Thresholds

- Start with 70% threshold for new projects
- Aim for 80%+ for production code
- Set 90%+ for critical business logic

### 2. File Organization

- Keep test files close to source files
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Separate unit, integration, and E2E tests

### 3. Test Quality

- Focus on meaningful tests, not just coverage numbers
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names and documentation

### 4. Continuous Integration

- Set up coverage gates in CI/CD
- Fail builds when coverage drops
- Monitor coverage trends over time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Coverage not collected**

```bash
# Ensure test framework is properly configured
npm run test:coverage
```

**Missing coverage files**

```bash
# Check coverage directory
ls -la coverage/
```

**Threshold too high**

```bash
# Start with lower threshold
npm run coverage -- --threshold 60
```

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose output for debugging:

```bash
DEBUG=coverage* npm run coverage
```

## Integration Examples

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
npm run coverage:check
```

### npm Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "precommit": "npm run coverage:check",
    "prepush": "npm run test:coverage",
    "coverage:watch": "jest --coverage --watch"
  }
}
```

### Docker Integration

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
RUN npm ci
RUN npm run test:coverage
COPY coverage/ /app/coverage/
```
