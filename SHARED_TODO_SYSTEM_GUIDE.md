# Shared Todo System Guide for LLMs

## Overview

The Shared Todo System is a collaborative task management platform that all LLMs in this ecosystem can access and contribute to. Every todo has complete identity tracking, showing who created it, who is working on it, who completed it, and who has made todos for future tasks.

## Key Features

### üîç **Complete Visibility**

- All LLMs can see all todos in the system
- Real-time status updates and progress tracking
- Full audit trail of all changes and activities

### üë• **Identity Tracking**

- **Created By**: Which LLM/agent created the todo
- **Assigned To**: Which LLM/agent is currently working on it
- **Completed By**: Which LLM/agent completed the task
- **Assigned By**: Which LLM/agent made the assignment
- **Comments**: Discussion and progress updates from any LLM

### üìä **Comprehensive Statistics**

- Individual agent performance metrics
- System-wide completion rates
- Activity timelines and history
- Category and priority breakdowns

### üîó **Workflow Integration**

- Automatic todo creation for operations

## Best Practices for LLMs

### 1. **Always Create Todos First**

Before starting any work, create a todo to document what you're doing:

```bash
node tools/scripts/shared-todo-cli.js create your-agent-id "Task description" --priority=medium
```

### 2. **Be Specific and Descriptive**

Use clear, actionable titles and detailed descriptions:

```bash
node tools/scripts/shared-todo-cli.js create your-agent-id "Implement OAuth2 authentication flow" \
  --description="Add Google OAuth2 login, token refresh, and user session management" \
  --priority=high \
  --category=feature \
  --tags=authentication,oauth2,security
```

### 3. **Update Progress Regularly**

Keep others informed of your progress:

```bash
node tools/scripts/shared-todo-cli.js comment your-agent-id todo-123 "Completed the OAuth2 setup, now working on token validation"
```

### 4. **Complete Tasks Properly**

When finishing work, provide context about what was accomplished:

```bash
node tools/scripts/shared-todo-cli.js complete your-agent-id todo-123 \
  --notes="Implemented complete OAuth2 flow with Google, including error handling and token refresh" \
  --result="Users can now log in with Google accounts"
```

### 5. **Help Others**

Check what others are working on and offer assistance:

```bash
# See what others need help with
node tools/scripts/shared-todo-cli.js unassigned

# Offer to help
node tools/scripts/shared-todo-cli.js comment your-agent-id todo-123 "I have experience with this - would you like me to take a look?"
```

### 6. **Assign Work Appropriately**

When delegating tasks, assign them to the right agents:

```bash
# Assign based on agent expertise
node tools/scripts/shared-todo-cli.js assign your-agent-id todo-123 database-expert-agent
```

## System Architecture

### Data Structure

Each todo contains:

```json
{
  "id": "todo-123",
  "title": "Implement user authentication",
  "description": "Add OAuth2 authentication flow",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "priority": "high",
  "category": "feature",

  "createdBy": "planning-agent",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-29T10:00:00Z",

  "assignedTo": "auth-agent",
  "assignedAt": "2025-10-29T10:15:00Z",
  "assignedBy": "planning-agent",

  "startedAt": "2025-10-29T10:30:00Z",

  "completedBy": "auth-agent",
  "completedAt": "2025-10-29T14:00:00Z",
  "result": "Authentication system fully implemented",

  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "comment-456",
      "agentId": "auth-agent",
      "content": "Working on the OAuth2 integration",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-29T11:00:00Z"
    }
  ],

  "history": [
    {
      "action": "created",
      "agentId": "planning-agent",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-29T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "action": "assigned",
      "agentId": "planning-agent",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-29T10:15:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Agent Statistics

Each agent tracks:

```json
{
  "totalCreated": 15,
  "totalAssigned": 12,
  "totalCompleted": 10,
  "activeTasks": 2,
  "completionRate": 83.3,
  "lastActivity": "2025-10-29T14:00:00Z"
}
```

### Audit Trail

All actions are logged:

```json
{
  "id": "audit-789",
  "action": "todo_completed",
  "agentId": "auth-agent",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T14:00:00Z",
  "details": {
    "todoId": "todo-123",
    "title": "Implement user authentication"
  }
}
```

## Integration with Todo Enforcement

The shared todo system integrates with the todo enforcement system:

1. **Automatic Todo Creation**: When agents start operations, todos are automatically created
2. **Enforcement**: Agents must have active todos to proceed with operations
3. **Progress Tracking**: Todo status updates automatically based on operation results
4. **Compliance Monitoring**: System tracks which agents are following todo workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Todo not found"**

- Check the todo ID is correct
- Use `search` to find the right todo
- Use `status` to see all available todos

**"Permission denied"**

- You can only modify todos assigned to you
- Use `assign` to assign todos to yourself first
- Ask the assignee to complete or reassign the todo

**"Agent not found"**

- Check the agent ID is spelled correctly
- Use `status` to see all available agents
- Agent IDs are case-sensitive
