# Task: Documentation Synchronization Engine

**ID**: 001-03
**Feature**: MCP Documentation Orchestration
**Status**: TODO
**Assignee**: TBD
**Sprint**: 3

## Description
Implement the core synchronization engine that monitors code changes, performs semantic analysis, and triggers automated documentation updates with intelligent drift detection.

## Prerequisites
- Task 001-02 (Spec-Kit Integration) completed
- Git hooks setup and configuration
- AST parsing libraries integrated

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Git monitoring service tracks repository changes in real-time
- [ ] AST analysis detects semantic changes in codebase
- [ ] Change classification system (critical/standard/minor) implemented
- [ ] Automated documentation update workflow created
- [ ] PR generation and management system functional
- [ ] Configuration options for sensitivity and automation level

## Implementation Notes
- Use Git hooks to trigger on pre-commit and post-commit events
- Implement AST parsing for TypeScript/JavaScript and Python files
- Create change classification rules based on impact assessment
- Build automated PR creation with proper templates and reviewers
- Include manual override and approval workflows for critical changes

## Testing
- **Unit**: Test AST analysis and change detection algorithms
- **Integration**: Verify Git hook triggering and workflow execution
- **E2E**: Test complete synchronization from code change to documentation update

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing in CI
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Merged to main
