# Feature Spec: MCP Documentation Orchestration

## Overview
Implement an advanced documentation orchestration system with GitHub Spec-Kit integration that maintains living documentation synchronized with code changes through intelligent drift detection and automated updates.

## Goals
- Establish living documentation that never becomes stale
- Implement intelligent synchronization between code and documentation
- Provide real-time documentation health monitoring and metrics
- Enable spec-driven development workflow with automated validation
- Create comprehensive documentation quality assurance framework

## User Stories

### US-1: Living Documentation Synchronization
As a developer, I want documentation to automatically update when code changes, so that I never have to manually maintain stale documentation

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Git hooks trigger documentation analysis on every commit
- [ ] AST analysis detects semantic changes in codebase
- [ ] Critical changes automatically generate documentation updates
- [ ] Pull requests are created for documentation review
- [ ] Documentation updates complete within 5 minutes of code change

### US-2: Spec-Kit Integration
As a product manager, I want to use GitHub Spec-Kit for specification-driven development, so that requirements are clearly defined and tracked through implementation

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] GitHub Spec-Kit CLI is installed and configured for the project
- [ ] Feature specifications follow 4-phase Spec-Kit workflow
- [ ] AI-assisted spec generation ensures consistency
- [ ] Specifications are version-controlled and reviewed
- [ ] Implementation progress is tracked against specifications

### US-3: Documentation Health Dashboard
As a team lead, I want a dashboard showing documentation quality and coverage metrics, so that I can identify and address documentation gaps proactively

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Dashboard displays real-time documentation health score
- [ ] Coverage metrics show percentage of documented components
- [ ] Freshness metrics indicate age of documentation updates
- [ ] Drift detection highlights code-documentation misalignment
- [ ] Historical trends show improvement over time

### US-4: Automated Quality Validation
As a documentation maintainer, I want automated validation of documentation quality, so that all documentation meets established standards

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Link checking validates all internal and external references
- [ ] Spell checking and grammar validation maintain professionalism
- [ ] Accessibility testing ensures WCAG compliance
- [ ] Code examples are automatically tested for accuracy
- [ ] Formatting validation ensures consistent style

### US-5: Developer Experience Integration
As a developer, I want documentation tools integrated into my development workflow, so that maintaining documentation requires minimal extra effort

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Slash commands provide quick documentation actions
- [ ] IDE extensions show relevant documentation context
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks validate documentation completeness
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline enforces documentation quality gates
- [ ] Documentation generation is part of build process

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Documentation updates complete within 5 minutes of code changes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for documentation dashboard and sync services
- **Scalability**: Support repositories with up to 10,000 files and 100 contributors
- **Security**: All documentation changes require authentication and authorization
- **Usability**: New team members can understand documentation system within 30 minutes

## Success Metrics
- 95% documentation coverage within 3 months of implementation
- Zero documentation debt older than 24 hours
- 90% reduction in manual documentation maintenance time
- 100% of new features include specifications before implementation
- Documentation health score above 85 within 6 months

## Dependencies
- GitHub repository with appropriate permissions
- Node.js runtime for automation scripts
- GitHub Spec-Kit CLI installation
- CI/CD pipeline integration (GitHub Actions)
- Team adoption of spec-driven development practices

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Team resistance to new documentation workflow
  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training and gradual rollout with pilot team
- **Risk**: Performance impact on development workflow
  **Mitigation**: Asynchronous processing and intelligent caching
- **Risk**: False positives in drift detection
  **Mitigation**: Configurable sensitivity and manual override capabilities
- **Risk**: Tooling complexity and maintenance overhead
  **Mitigation**: Automated testing and monitoring of documentation tools
