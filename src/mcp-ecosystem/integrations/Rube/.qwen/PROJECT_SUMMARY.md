# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Set up and configure the Rube Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to connect AI tools like Qwen, Claude, OpenCode, and Cursor to 500+ apps including Gmail, Slack, GitHub, and Notion.

## Key Knowledge
- The Rube MCP server is hosted remotely at `https://rube.composio.dev/mcp`
- The server requires JWT authentication for protected endpoints
- Environment variables are configured in `.env` file with API keys for various services
- The server supports both HTTP and streamable HTTP transports
- OpenCode was failing to connect due to authentication issues (401 error: "No authorization provided")
- The authentication flow involves OAuth for connecting apps, then JWT tokens for MCP endpoints
- OpenCode configuration is stored in `~/.config/opencode/config.json`
- The Rube server was configured with apps already connected online

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Added dotenv support to bin/rube.js and index.js to load environment variables
- [DONE] Created and configured the OpenCode configuration file with the remote Rube server URL and authentication token
- [DONE] Generated a JWT token specifically for OpenCode authentication with appropriate permissions
- [DONE] Created a Prisma schema with proper relations for database models
- [DONE] Added Docker and Docker Compose configuration for containerized deployment
- [DONE] Created token generation scripts for various authentication needs
- [DONE] Updated README.md with comprehensive technical documentation
- [DONE] Committed all changes to the local git repository with descriptive commit messages
- [DONE] Configured Claude Desktop to connect to the Rube MCP server

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Set up OpenCode to connect to the remote Rube server using JWT authentication
- [DONE] Generate authentication tokens for MCP client connections
- [DONE] Configure proper server endpoints for MCP protocol compliance
- [TODO] Test OpenCode functionality with the Rube server to ensure authentication works
- [TODO] Set up additional AI clients (Qwen, Cursor, Gemini) with the Rube MCP server
- [TODO] Verify that all connected apps (Gmail, GitHub, etc.) are accessible through the MCP protocol
- [TODO] Troubleshoot any remaining authentication or connection issues with different AI clients
