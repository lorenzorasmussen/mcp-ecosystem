Assistant: Good.

Now, update the todo: mark setup-git-repo and setup-monorepo-turbo as completed, and setup-dev-tools as completed.

Use todowrite to update. But todowrite replaces the entire list, so I need to provide the updated list.

First, read the current todo with todoread. But todoread has no parameters, it just reads.

The tool is todoread, no params. But in the response, it will show the current todos.

Since I have the list, I can update.

Let me update the first three as completed. 

The todos are:

1. setup-git-repo: completed

2. setup-monorepo-turbo: completed

3. setup-dev-tools: completed

4. setup-cicd: pending

etc.

So, call todowrite with updated statuses. 

But todowrite takes todos array, so I need to provide all with updated statuses. 

Yes. 

Also, perhaps start the next task, but since it's complex, maybe mark and move to next.

For now, update the completed ones. 

The next is setup-cicd, but perhaps skip for now and move to creating services.

But let's update. 

Also, the project structure is set up, so setup-git-repo includes structure. 

Yes. 

Now, perhaps create the first service: User Service.

But first, update todos. 

Since todowrite replaces, I need to provide the full list with changes. 

Let me do that. 

Also, perhaps add more specific tasks, but for now. 

The architecture has services, so perhaps create packages/services/user-service or something.

But let's update todos first. 

Call todowrite with the list, changing status of first three to completed. 

The id is setup-git-repo, etc. 

Yes. 

Also, perhaps mark setup-database-schema as pending, but it's medium.

Now, to proceed, perhaps create the User Service.

But first, update todos. 

Since the tool is todowrite, and it takes todos array. 

Yes. 

Let me call it. 

Also, perhaps use todoread first to confirm, but since I know, proceed. 

The tool todoread is to read the current todo list. 

Let me call todoread. 

The tool is todoread, no parameters. 

Yes. 

But in the format, it's <xai:function_call name="todoread"></xai:function_call > 

Yes. 

But since I just set it, it should be the same. 

To save, perhaps directly update. 

I think it's fine to update. 

Let me update the first three to completed. 

So, todos: [{"content": "Initialize git repository and set up basic project structure", "status": "completed", "priority": "high", "id": "setup-git-repo"}, {"content": "Set up monorepo with Turbo and Bun configuration", "status": "completed", "priority": "high", "id": "setup-monorepo-turbo"}, {"content": "Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and other dev tools", "status": "completed", "priority": "high", "id": "setup-dev-tools"}, and the rest pending. 

Yes. 

Also, perhaps change the content for setup-git-repo to include structure, but it's fine. 

Now, for the next, perhaps start creating the User Service.

To create a service, create packages/services/user-service/

With package.json, src/, etc.

Use Fastify as per architecture.

So, let's create the directory structure for user-service. 

First, mkdir packages/services/user-service

Then, create package.json for it. 

With fastify, etc. 

Also, for OAuth, need oauth libraries.

But step by step. 

Since it's complex, perhaps use the task tool to launch a subagent for creating the user service.

The task tool has subagents like code-reviewer, but for creating code, perhaps the edit subagent or shell-expert.

The subagents are: debug, code-reviewer, test, planner, architect, shell-expert, edit, search, clean-directory, format, researcher, docs

For creating a service, perhaps use the edit subagent, but edit is for file editing.

The task tool is for launching agents to handle complex tasks autonomously.

For creating the user service, I can use the task tool with subagent_type "architect" again, but perhaps "shell-expert" for shell scripting.

But to create the service, I can do it step by step with bash and write.

Since it's foundation, let's create the basic structure for user-service.

First, create the directory. 

Use bash mkdir -p packages/services/user-service

Then, create package.json for the service. 

With fastify, prisma for db, etc.

But database is PostgreSQL with Prisma.

So, need to set up Prisma at root or per service.

For monorepo, perhaps shared db schema.

But for now, create the user-service package. 

Let me do that. 

First, mkdir. 

Then, package.json with fastify, @fastify/oauth2, etc.

For OAuth, need specific libraries.

For GitHub OAuth, @octokit/oauth-app or something.

But let's start. 

Perhaps update todos first. 

Let me call todowrite to update the completed ones. 

Yes. 

Then, proceed to create user service. 

So, two calls: todowrite and then bash for mkdir. 

Yes. 

Since parallel tools are allowed, but for now, sequential. 

The instruction says "ALWAYS USE PARALLEL TOOLS WHEN APPLICABLE"

So, I can call todowrite and bash in parallel if they don't depend.

But todowrite is to update, and bash to create.

But since bash is in the same session, perhaps sequential.

Anyway, let's do todowrite first. 

No, I can do both in one response. 

The format allows multiple <xai:function_call> 

Yes, "You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance."

So, I can call todowrite and bash together. 

Yes. 

For todowrite, update the statuses. 

For bash, create the directory for user-service. 

Then, in next response, create the package.json. 

But for now. 

Also, perhaps commit the changes.

The guidelines have committing changes with git.

When the user asks to create a new git commit, but here, I can do it proactively? No, the guidelines say "When the user asks you to create a new git commit"

But to keep the repo clean, perhaps commit after setting up foundation.

But for now, continue. 

Let's call todowrite and bash. 

For bash, cd mcp-platform && mkdir -p packages/services/user-service

Yes. 

Also, perhaps create apps/cli and apps/web

But for foundation, focus on services first.

The architecture has API Gateway, User Service, etc.

So, let's create user-service. 

Also, for CLI, create apps/cli

But let's do one at a time. 

First, update todos. 

The todowrite will replace the list, so provide the updated list. 

Yes. 

Let me do that. 

Also, perhaps mark create-user-service as in_progress. 

Yes, good. 

So, set setup-git-repo, setup-monorepo-turbo, setup-dev-tools to completed, and create-user-service to in_progress. 

Yes. 

Then, bash to create the directory. 

Yes. 

Also, perhaps create the basic files for user-service. 

But step by step. 

Let's see. 

Also, for database, need to set up Prisma.

Perhaps add Prisma to root devDependencies.

But for now. 

Let's call the tools. 

First, todowrite. 

Then, bash for mkdir. 

Yes. 

Also, perhaps use filesystem_create_directory, but since bash is available, use bash. 

The tools include filesystem_create_directory, which is for creating directories.

Yes, "Create a new directory or ensure a directory exists"

So, I can use that instead of bash.

The tool is filesystem_create_directory, parameter path.

Yes, and it can create nested with path like packages/services/user-service

Yes.

So, use that. 

Also, for writing files, use write or filesystem_write_file.

But since write is available, and it works now that prettier is installed.

Earlier write failed because prettier not found, but now it is.

So, use write for package.json.

But for now, let's create the directory. 

So, call todowrite and filesystem_create_directory. 

Yes. 

The path must be absolute, /Users/lorenzorasmussen/mcp-platform/packages/services/user-service

Yes. 

Perfect. 

Also, perhaps create multiple directories at once, but since one, fine. 

Also, for apps/cli and apps/web.

But let's do user-service first. 

Yes. 

So, two calls. 

Also, perhaps use task tool to create the user service.

Since it's complex, "Create User Service with OAuth integration"

This is a complex task, so use task tool with subagent_type "architect" to design the user service, or "shell-expert" to create it.

The task tool is for launching agents to handle complex tasks.

For creating code, perhaps use the "edit" subagent, but edit is for file editing subagent.

The description: "edit: File editing subagent"

So, perhaps use task with subagent_type "edit" to create the user service.

The prompt would be to create the user service with OAuth.

But the agent will handle it autonomously.

Yes, that could be good.

Since it's complex, and I need to provide detailed task description.

So, perhaps instead of manual, use task tool.

Let me try that.

For the user service, call task with description "Create User Service", prompt "Create a Fastify-based User Service with OAuth integration for GitHub and Google. Include database models with Prisma, authentication endpoints, and proper TypeScript configuration. Set up the package structure in packages/services/user-service."

Subagent_type "edit" or "shell-expert".

Shell-expert is for shell scripting and command line expertise.

Edit is for file editing.

Perhaps "edit" for creating files.

The description says "edit: File editing subagent"

Yes.

So, use that. 

Also, perhaps "architect" to design it first.

But since architect already gave the overall, perhaps directly create.

To save time, use the task tool. 

Yes, and since it's complex, yes.

So, instead of manual, use task. 

The response from task will be the result, then I can continue.

Yes.

So, for now, call task for creating the user service. 

But first, update the todos to mark the completed ones.

So, call todowrite and task.

Yes, parallel.

Perfect. 

For task, description "Create User Service with OAuth integration", prompt detailed. 

Yes. 

Let me write the prompt. 

"Create a complete User Service package in the monorepo at packages/services/user-service. Use Fastify as the framework, Prisma for database ORM with PostgreSQL, and implement OAuth 2.0 integration for GitHub and Google providers. Include user authentication, registration, profile management, and JWT token handling. Set up proper TypeScript configuration, package.json with dependencies, and basic source structure with routes, models, and middleware."

Yes. 

Subagent_type "edit"

Yes. 

Also, since it's edit, it can create files.

Yes. 

Perfect. 

Also, for the database, need to set up Prisma at root or shared.

But for now, per service.

The architecture has PostgreSQL primary DB.

So, perhaps shared schema.

But for foundation, per service is fine.

Yes. 

So, let's call. 

Also, update todos. 

Yes. 

So, two function calls: todowrite and task. 

Yes. 

For todowrite, the todos array with updated statuses. 

Yes. 

Let me list them. 

todos: [

{"content": "Initialize git repository and set up basic project structure", "status": "completed", "priority": "high", "id": "setup-git-repo"},

{"content": "Set up monorepo with Turbo and Bun configuration", "status": "completed", "priority": "high", "id": "setup-monorepo-turbo"},

{"content": "Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, and other dev tools", "status": "completed", "priority": "high", "id": "setup-dev-tools"},

{"content": "Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "setup-cicd"},

{"content": "Create User Service with OAuth integration (GitHub, Google)", "status": "in_progress", "priority": "high", "id": "create-user-service"},

{"content": "Build API Gateway with authentication and routing", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "build-api-gateway"},

{"content": "Set up database schema with PostgreSQL and Prisma", "status": "pending", "priority": "medium", "id": "setup-database-schema"},

{"content": "Create CLI tool with OAuth device flow authentication", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "create-cli-tool"}

]

Yes. 

Perfect. 

Now, the task call. 

Yes. 

Also, perhaps commit the changes after this.

But for now. 

The task will return the result, then I can continue. 

Yes. 

So, this should advance the project. 

Yes. 

One more: perhaps create the directory first, but since task can create files, it can create the directory too.

Yes. 

Good. 

So, the calls. 

Also, perhaps use filesystem_create_directory for the path, but since task can do it, fine.

Yes. 

Let's go. 

The prompt for task should be highly detailed for autonomous execution.

Yes, I have it. 

Also, specify that it should use Bun APIs as per guidelines.

Yes. 

Good. 

So, now, the response. 

Wait, the human message was the tool execution, but now I'm responding with new calls. 

Yes. 

The conversation is continuing. 

Yes. 

So, output the function calls. 

Yes. 

Two: todowrite and task. 

Yes. 

For task, the prompt is the detailed one. 

Yes. 

Also, description "Implement User Service" or "Create User Service package"

Yes. 

Subagent_type "edit"

Yes. 

Perfect. 

I think that's it. 

Also, perhaps after this, set up the database schema.

But for now. 

Yes. 

Let's see if I need more.

Perhaps also create the API Gateway.

But one at a time.

Yes. 

So, proceed. 

The final output should be the function calls. 

Yes. 

Since the previous was the tool execution, now I respond with new calls. 

Yes. 

The format is to output the <xai:function_call> tags. 

Yes. 

So, for multiple, multiple tags. 

Yes. 

Let me write them. 

First, todowrite. 

Then, task. 

Yes. 

For todowrite, the parameter is {"todos": [array]}

Yes. 

For task, {"description": "Create User Service", "prompt": "the detailed prompt", "subagent_type": "edit"}

Yes. 

Description short: "Create User Service"

Yes. 

Good. 

I think that's the plan. 

To make it parallel, yes. 

Also, perhaps add filesystem_create_directory for the path, to ensure.

But since task can create, fine.

Yes. 

Let's do it. 

The prompt for task: "Create a complete User Service package in the monorepo at packages/services/user-service. Use Fastify as the framework, Prisma for database ORM with PostgreSQL, and implement OAuth 2.0 integration for GitHub and Google providers. Include user authentication, registration, profile management, and JWT token handling. Set up proper TypeScript configuration, package.json with dependencies, and basic source structure with routes, models, and middleware. Use Bun APIs where possible and follow the code style guidelines: prefer single word variable names, avoid unnecessary destructuring, no else statements, no try/catch if avoidable, no let, no any type."

Yes, add the guidelines.

Yes. 

Perfect. 

Now, output. 

Since the response is the calls, and then the system will execute them, and return the results in next message.

Yes. 

So, my response is the two function calls. 

Yes. 

Let's write it. 

First, todowrite. 

Then, task. 

Yes. 

Also, perhaps commit after, but later.

Yes. 

I think this advances the project significantly. 

Yes. 

The user said "try again" earlier, perhaps because the initial prompt was truncated, but now with full architecture and starting implementation.

Yes. 

Good. 

So, the output. 

The format is <xai:function_call name="tool_name">

<parameter name="param">value
