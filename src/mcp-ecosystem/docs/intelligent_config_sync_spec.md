# Feature Spec: Intelligent Configuration Sync

## Overview

The Intelligent Configuration Sync feature provides automated detection, repair, and synchronization of configuration files across the OpenCode development environment. Adapting the webhook notification pattern, this system monitors configuration drift in real-time and triggers intelligent repair actions, ensuring configuration integrity without manual intervention.

## Problem Statement

In complex development environments with multiple agents (architect, planner, tester, etc.), configuration files can drift from their intended state due to:
- Manual edits bypassing validation
- Agent actions modifying configs without proper tracking
- Environment-specific overrides conflicting with base configurations
- Zsh configuration modules becoming out of sync
- MCP server configurations diverging from standards

Current manual processes are error-prone and time-consuming, leading to inconsistent development experiences and potential system failures.

## Solution

Implement an intelligent configuration sync system that:
- Continuously monitors configuration files for drift
- Automatically repairs detected issues using predefined rules
- Syncs configurations across agents and environments
- Provides real-time notifications of configuration changes
- Maintains audit trails of all configuration modifications

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Configuration Drift Detection
- **REQ-1.1**: Monitor all configuration files in `.opencode/`, `config-guardian/`, and Zsh config directories
- **REQ-1.2**: Detect drift using checksum validation, syntax checking, and semantic analysis
- **REQ-1.3**: Support multiple configuration formats (JSON, YAML, TOML, shell scripts)
- **REQ-1.4**: Provide configurable drift detection intervals (real-time to daily)

#### Intelligent Auto-Repair
- **REQ-2.1**: Apply repair rules based on configuration type and context
- **REQ-2.2**: Support rollback to previous known-good states
- **REQ-2.3**: Validate repairs before applying to prevent cascading failures
- **REQ-2.4**: Handle conflicts between multiple repair suggestions

#### Synchronization Engine
- **REQ-3.1**: Sync configurations across multiple OpenCode agents
- **REQ-3.2**: Support environment-specific overrides while maintaining base consistency
- **REQ-3.3**: Handle distributed configuration updates in multi-agent scenarios
- **REQ-3.4**: Provide conflict resolution for concurrent modifications

#### Notification System
- **REQ-4.1**: Send real-time notifications for configuration drift detection
- **REQ-4.2**: Alert on failed auto-repair attempts requiring manual intervention
- **REQ-4.3**: Provide summary reports of configuration health status
- **REQ-4.4**: Support multiple notification channels (in-app, email, Slack)

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **PERF-1**: Detect drift within 100ms of file modification
- **PERF-2**: Complete auto-repair operations within 5 seconds
- **PERF-3**: Handle up to 1000 configuration files without performance degradation

#### Reliability
- **REL-1**: Maintain 99.9% uptime for configuration monitoring
- **REL-2**: Never apply incorrect repairs that could break functionality
- **REL-3**: Provide graceful degradation when sync services are unavailable

#### Security
- **SEC-1**: Encrypt sensitive configuration data in transit and at rest
- **SEC-2**: Implement access controls for configuration modification
- **SEC-3**: Audit all configuration changes with immutable logs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Primary Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Drift Detection and Auto-Repair
**Given** a configuration file has been modified incorrectly
**When** the system detects the drift
**Then** it automatically applies the appropriate repair rule
**And** notifies the user of the action taken

#### Scenario 2: Manual Override Handling
**Given** a user has intentionally modified a configuration
**When** the system detects the change
**Then** it validates the change against known patterns
**And** either accepts it or prompts for confirmation

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Agent Synchronization
**Given** multiple OpenCode agents are running
**When** one agent updates a shared configuration
**Then** all other agents receive the update within 1 second
**And** maintain consistency across the environment

### Edge Cases

- **EC-1**: Configuration file is deleted - system recreates from template
- **EC-2**: Network partition during sync - system queues updates for retry
- **EC-3**: Conflicting changes from multiple sources - system implements merge strategy
- **EC-4**: Invalid repair rules - system falls back to manual notification

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
- **Config-Guardian**: Leverage existing configuration tracking system
- **OpenCode Agents**: Integrate with agent lifecycle for configuration updates
- **Zsh Config**: Support modular Zsh configuration synchronization
- **MCP Servers**: Monitor and sync MCP server configurations

### Data Structures
- Configuration metadata with checksums, timestamps, and validation rules
- Repair rule engine with pattern matching and action definitions
- Synchronization queue for distributed updates
- Audit log with immutable change history

### Dependencies
- File system monitoring libraries
- Configuration parsing libraries for multiple formats
- Notification delivery system
- Encryption libraries for secure data handling
